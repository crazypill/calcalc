*calcalc* - calculates number of hours for a given calender of events.  It searches thru your calender looking for events between certain dates and spits out the total.

I use it for consulting work.  I just add hours to my work calendar and at the end of the contract, I export that calendar as .ics file and then use that as input to this little utility.

The arguments are:

-s 'start date in MM/DD/YYYY'
-e 'end data in MM/DD/YYYY'
-f input file

-s and -e are optional...
